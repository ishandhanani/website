            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>Hi there! I am a rising senior at Texas A&M studying Economics and Statistics. My passions and skillsets lie at the intersection of data science and blockchain technology. 
                This summer, I will be working at Spark Cognition as a Data Science QA intern on their model workbench team.</p>
            <p>I am continously pushing myself to learn new things. Currently, I am focused on strengthening my computer science background through courses in Data Structures and Algorithms. 
                I am also experimenting with Solidity and smart contract development on the EVM. During my senior year, I will be taking courses in deep learning while continuing to expand my web3 development skills.
            </p>
            <h2>Experience</h2>
            <h3><u>Spark Cognition - Data Science Intern</u></h3>
            <p>I will be working on the backend of the Darwin model workbench. This internship starts June 2022</p>

            <h3><u>Differential Capital - Cryptocurrency Data Analyst</u></h3>
            <p>My team and I developed an interactive crypocurrency dashboard for prospective hedge-fund investment. The dashboard features include techincal analysis, sentiment analysis, statistical relationships, and visual aesthetics.
                The dashboard was built from scratch and pulls data from API's. Currently, I am working on implementing AWS Lambda in order to auto-refresh the OHLCV data being pulled.</p>

            <h3><u>Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis - Treasury Analytics Consultant</u></h3>
            <p>I worked on optimizing short and long term models to forecast Treasury account balances using different regression techniques. I gained exposure to all steps of ML modeling from data exploration to model selection and deployment.
                Additionally, I assisted an RPA team in automating excel spreadsheets and developed technical documentation for the models and programs.</p>
